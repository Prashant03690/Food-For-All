# Food-For-All
Food For All is a web app that connects restaurants, NGOs, and Food Product Units (FPUs) while serving as an e-commerce platform for food products. Built with Java (J2EE) and Spring Boot for the backend, and ReactJS and Bootstrap for the frontend, it facilitates food donations, reduces waste, and allows users to purchase food items easily.
